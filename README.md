Eclipse plugin for integrating MetaEdit+ to Eclipse

The MetaEdit+ plugin for Eclipse provides integration between [MetaEdit+](http://www.metacase.com/products.html) and [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/). MetaEdit+ is the leading [Domain-Specific Modeling](http://www.dsmforum.org/) tool, so it seemed right to integrate it with leading IDEs; for more information on MetaEdit+ please see [MetaCase's](http://www.metacase.com/) web site. The plugin allows you to browse MetaEdit+ models and use the main MetaEdit+ functions from Eclipse. It can also automatically import into Eclipse the source code generated from MetaEdit+.

The integration between MetaEdit+ models and Eclipse includes:

* launching MetaEdit+ from Eclipse and logging in, opening MetaEdit+ projects and starting its API,
* showing the MetaEdit+ model hierarchy in an Eclipse tree view,
* opening and editing MetaEdit+ models from Eclipse,
* running generators on MetaEdit+ models, and importing the results as Eclipse solutions.
