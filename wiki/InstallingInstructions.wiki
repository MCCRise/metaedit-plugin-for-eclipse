#summary Short instructions on how to install the MetaEdit+ plugin for Eclipse

== Install Eclipse ==

Download and install [http://eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse]. (Tested with [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigosr1 Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers] and [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-371/indigosr1 Eclipse Classic])

== Install !MetaEdit+ ==

Download and install [http://www.metacase.com/download/ MetaEdit+ 5.0]. (Basic plugin functionality will also work with the 4.5 version, but since all instructions and examples are for 5.0, it's best to start with 5.0.)

== Install the plugin ==

There are two alternative ways of installing the plugin:
 * Install the plugin from the update site. Open Eclipse and choose *Help | Install New Software*, set the update site to {{{http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/MEplusGraphBrowser/}}} and follow the instructions in the wizard.
 * Download the plugin as a single JAR file from [
https://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/MEplusGraphBrowser/plugins/com.metacase.graphbrowser_1.0.6.jar here]. Place it in the plugins folder under your Eclipse installation folder.

For using the plugin see the [GettingStarted getting started] page.
