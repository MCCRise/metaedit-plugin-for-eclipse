#summary How the plugin works and how you can extend it
= How the plugin works =

This page contains information about how the plugin works, and how to modify or extend it for your own use. The plugin source code is available from [http://code.google.com/p/metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse/source/browse/ here].

== Launching the plugin ==

When the plugin starts it will search for an existing open API connection to MetaEdit+. If it finds one, it will ask for all the graphs in all opened projects in !MetaEdit+ and show them in the view. If the plugin doesn’t find an API connection it will look in the root directory of the current Eclipse workspace for a settings file, ‘default.mer’, that contains !MetaEdit+ launch parameters. If it finds the settings file, the plugin asks the user's permission to launch !MetaEdit+, log in, open projects and start the API server in !MetaEdit+.

When using the plugin for first time there is no settings file and no open API connection to !MetaEdit+. In this case the plugin tries to calculate the values that are needed for launching !MetaEdit+ and shows them in a dialog to user. When the user has checked and edited them if needed, !MetaEdit+ can be launched by clicking the ‘Open !MetaEdit+’ button. The launch parameters are also saved in the ‘default.mer’ file in the workspace root directory, and will be read when the plugin is next launched without an API connection.

== The generation and import process ==

The generation and import process contains stages in which the plugin writes a plugin.ini file for !MetaEdit+, a generator for the selected graph is run in !MetaEdit+, the generated Eclipse project (if any) is imported in Eclipse, opened, built and launched in Eclipse automatically. Let's look next at the individual states in more detail. You may also test these by running the 'Digital Watch' example available in !MetaEdit+.

In the first stage a plugin.ini file for !MetaEdit+ is written in the !MetaEdit+ working directory. Once the user has chosen to run a generator the file is created. The plugin.ini file contains information from the application (Eclipse in this case) that calls !MetaEdit+. It also contains the Eclipse workspace path in which the !MetaEdit+ generator is supposed to generate the source code files. Below you can see an example of the plugin.ini file content.
{{{
IDE=eclipse
workspace=C:\user\Documents and settings\workspace\
}}}
The file and its content allow the generator in !MetaEdit+ to see that it is being used from another program. The generator can thus change its behaviour, e.g. instead of compiling and opening generated code itself, it can just generate the source code and project resource files that are needed for importing and building the project in Eclipse. The plugin removes the plugin.ini file at the end of the process.

After !MetaEdit+ has generated the source code files, the plugin looks for a Java project with the same name as the graph selected in the plugin tree view. If a project is found, it is imported into Eclipse and opened. After that the project is built and run, so the user can go straight to seeing the generated program running.

The project import automates otherwise manual actions like choosing to create a new project from the File menu and going through the wizard to create a new project. While these actions could be left for the user, the plugin aims to automate integration between code generated from !MetaEdit+ and Eclipse. To provide this automation the !MetaEdit+ generator creates Eclipse project resource files that are needed for opening the project in Eclipse, and the Eclipse plugin provides the project import, build and launch commands.

== Writing your own generator ==

The most common scenario for the plugin is for the generated source code to end up in an Eclipse project and be compiled and run from there. To do that, the plugin and generator must work together, following this interface: 

  * Name the generator 'Autobuild'
  * Read the Eclipse workspace directory from the plugin.ini file created by the plugin
  * Generate the source files under that directory
  * Generate an Eclipse project file in that directory, with the same name as the graph, and referring to the generated source code

== Extending the plugin ==

You can easily modify the plugin to add extra functions that you'd like, or to change the existing behaviour. !MetaEdit+ commands, for example commit and abandon or editing the graphs programmatically, are available via the API similarly to the commands that are used in this plugin. For more information, see the API section in the !MetaEdit+ manual and the [http://code.google.com/p/metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse/source/browse/ source code] of this plugin.
