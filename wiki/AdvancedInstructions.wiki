This is a usage guide page for functions of the !MetaEdit+ plugin for Eclipse.

== Commands ==

The plugin provides commands that may be used from buttons in the views toolbar or by selecting a graph from the tree and clicking the mouse right button.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/run_generator_icon.png *Run Autobuild* runs generator named "Autobuild" for the selected graph. If no graph is selected, no action is taken.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/select_generator_to_run_icon.png *Select Generator to Run* allows to run generator for the selected graph. If no graph is selected, no action is taken. Since a graph may have more than one generator the plugin asks all available generators from !MetaEdit+ and shows them in a list dialog for selection. Depending on the selected generator this commandmay start several automated steps, like produce the code, importing it to Eclipse and running the generated project. See below for further information.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/open_graph_in_metaedit_icon.png *Open Graph in !MetaEdit+* opens the same graph in !MetaEdit+ that is selected in the tree view. If no graph is selected, no action is taken. This way user gets to edit the graphs quickly in !MetaEdit+.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/update_graph_list_icon.png *Update Graph List* updates the treeview. Before asking the graphs from !MetaEdit+, it tests the API connection and tries to launch !MetaEdit+ as in the plugin startup. This command is useful for both updating the graph list and initializing the whole treeview if the plugin was started without API connection.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/settings_icon.png *Open Settings* opens a dialog that contains the !MetaEdit+ launch parameters. The parameters are saved in 'default.mer' file in the Eclipse workspace root and are read when launching !MetaEdit+ or when initalizing the settings dialog. The dialog provides a three step verifier for each text field. green when content is correct, yellow if the entry could not be verified, or red when entry is not correct.

In the popup menu (mouse right click) there are two commands that are not shown in the view toolbar. These commands are only for !MetaEdit+ 5.0 version.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/create_graph_icon.png *Create a new Graph* will open a !MetaEdit+ dialog for creating a new graph. If no graph is selected, a dialog opens to ask which type of graph will be created. If graph is selected the dialog will automatically have the same type as the selected graph.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/edit_properties_icon.png *Edit Graph Properties* opens graph properties dialog in !MetaEdit+ and lets user to edit the graph's properties. This function always depends on selected graph so the command is shown in the popup menu only when there is a selection in the tree view.
