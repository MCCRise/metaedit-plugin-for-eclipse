#summary Using the plugin

= Plugin functions =

This is a usage guide page for functions of the !MetaEdit+ plugin for Eclipse.

== Commands ==

The plugin provides commands that may be used from buttons in the views toolbar or by selecting a graph from the tree and clicking the mouse right button.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/run_generator_icon.png *Run Autobuild* runs the generator "Autobuild" to the selected graph. If no graph is selected, no action is taken.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/select_generator_to_run_icon.png *Select Generator to Run* allows you to select and run a specific generator for the selected graph. If no graph is selected, no action is taken. Since a graph may have more than one generator the plugin retrieves all available generators from !MetaEdit+ and shows them in a list dialog for selection. Depending on the selected generator this command may start several automated steps, like producing the code, importing it to Eclipse and running the generated project. See below for further information.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/open_graph_in_metaedit_icon.png *Open Graph in !MetaEdit+* opens the selected graph in !MetaEdit+. If no graph is selected, no action is taken. This way user is able to access and modify graphs quickly in !MetaEdit+.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/update_graph_list_icon.png *Update Graph List* updates the treeview. Before fetcing the graphs from !MetaEdit+ the API connection is tested. This command is useful for both updating the graph list and initializing the whole treeview if the plugin was started without API connection.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/settings_icon.png *Open Settings* opens a dialog that contains the !MetaEdit+ launch parameters. The parameters are saved in 'default.mer' file in the Eclipse workspace root and are read when launching !MetaEdit+ or when initalizing the settings dialog. The dialog provides a three step verifier for each text field. Green if the content is correct, yellow if the entry could not be verified, or red when entry is not correct.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/folder_explore.png *Show/Hide graph type* toggles the graph typename on or off.

In the popup menu (mouse right click) there are two commands available for use only from the popup menu. These commands apply only for !MetaEdit+ 5.0 version.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/create_graph_icon.png *Create a new Graph* will open a !MetaEdit+ dialog for creating a new graph. If no graph is selected, a dialog opens to ask the type of the new graph. If graph is selected the new graph will automatically have the same type as the selected graph.

 http://metaedit-plugin-for-eclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/com.metacase.graphbrowser/icons/edit_properties_icon.png *Edit Graph Properties* opens graph properties dialog in !MetaEdit+ and lets user to edit the graph's properties. This function depends always on the selected graph so the command is shown in the popup menu only when a graph is selected from the graph tree.
