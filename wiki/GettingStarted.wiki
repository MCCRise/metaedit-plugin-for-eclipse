#summary Getting started with the plugin in Eclipse

= Getting started =

When you have eclipse and plugin installed run Eclipse. In workbench open the plugin by clicking *Window | Show view | Other | !MetaEdit+ | Graph Browser*.

The plugin tries to connect to !MetaEdit+ API server at startup. If it doesn't find any available connection, it'll ask the user to allow launching !MetaEdit+ and starting the API server. For login the plugin needs parameters of the right database. These parameters are stored in 'default.mer' file that is saved in the root of Eclipse workspace.

When running the plugin for the first time there is no 'default.mer' file. In this case the plugin tries to search some paths needed for launching !MetaEdit+ and shows them to user who can edit and accept them by clicking 'Open !MetaEdit+'. Accepting them will open !MetaEdit+. If the plugin doesn't show any models after launching !MetaEdit+ and API try clicking the 'Update Graph List' icon on Graph Browser toolbar.

When running you'll see in Graph Browser plugin the models from !MetaEdit+. Figure below shows the plugin listing the 'Digital watch' example models in Eclipse.

To enable Eclipse to import the generated source code set the *Generation target platform* to *Java: Windows* or *Java: API* in !MetaEdit+ Digital Watch example.

*If you want to try the integration like shown here you need to download the !MetaEdit+ 5.0 beta and use the demo repository that is shipped with the beta version.*
