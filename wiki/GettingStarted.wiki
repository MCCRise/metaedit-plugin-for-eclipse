#summary Getting started with the plugin in Eclipse

= Getting started =

When you have Eclipse, !MetaEdit+ and the plugin [InstallingInstructions installed], run Eclipse. In the Eclipse Workbench open the plugin with *Window | Show view | Other | !MetaEdit+ | Graph Browser*.

The plugin tries to connect to the !MetaEdit+ API server at startup. If it doesn't find any available connection, it will offer to launch !MetaEdit+, start the API server, and login to the repository. This needs some paths and other parameters, which are stored in a 'default.mer' file that is saved in the root of the Eclipse workspace.

When running the plugin for the first time there is no 'default.mer' file. In this case the plugin tries to find and suggest the correct paths needed for launching !MetaEdit+. It shows them to user who can edit and accept them by clicking 'Open !MetaEdit+'. Accepting them will open !MetaEdit+. If the plugin doesn't show any models after starting !MetaEdit+ and its API, try clicking the 'Update Graph List' icon on the plugin's toolbar.

When running, the plugin will show the hierarchy of your models from !MetaEdit+. The figure below shows the plugin listing the 'Digital watch' example models in Eclipse.

In !MetaEdit+ 5.0 and 5.1, the Digital Watch example has been updated to show the plugin's ability to import generated code into an Eclipse project. To see this: 
  * Select the top-level graph in the plugin
  * Choose *Edit Graph Properties* from the pop-up menu and set the *Generation target platform* to *Java: Windows* or *Java: API*
  * Press the plugin's Run Autobuild toolbar button.
